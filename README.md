# Social Network API

Your challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

* _WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application_
* _THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database_  
* _WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts_
* _THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON_
* _WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia_
* _THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database_
